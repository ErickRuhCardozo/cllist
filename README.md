# CLLIST - C LinkedList Library
<p>This repo contains a C implementation of the LinkedList data structure in two versions:</p>
* The first is a standalone int LinkedList that can be built as shared library. It can be found in the [main branch](https://github.com/ErickRuhCardozo/cllist/tree/main)

* The second is a (kind of) generic implementation using preprocessor macros, giving the possibility of have LinkedLists of different types in your program. It can be found in the [generic branch](https://github.com/ErickRuhCardozo/cllist/tree/generic)

<p>Each branch have its own examples. Any kind of contribution is welcome!</p>
