# CLLIST - C LinkedList Library
<p>This repo contains a C implementation of the LinkedList data structure in two versions:</p>
* The first is a standalone int LinkedList that can be built as shared library.

* The second is a (kind of) generic implementation using preprocessor macros, giving the possibility of have LinkedLists of different types in your program.

<p>Each branch have its own examples. Any kind of contribution is welcome!</p>
